💡 Ever wondered if a Mini GPT or Small LLM can understand your text and generate intelligent responses—just like ChatGPT?
In this video, I’ll show you how I built a Mini GPT LLM from scratch using Python, Transformers, and custom training—a complete end-to-end AI project. 🤖✨

GitHub Code Link :

We’ll go step by step:
✅ Building a tokenizer and preparing text datasets
✅ Training a small Transformer-based language model
✅ Fine-tuning the LLM on custom data (Q&A, chat, summaries)
✅ Creating a ChatGPT-like interface for interacting with your model
✅ Deploying the Mini GPT model locally or on a simple web app ⚡

This is a full End-to-End NLP + LLM Project—perfect for students, beginners, or anyone wanting a strong portfolio project in AI and Large Language Models.

✨ By the end, you’ll learn how to:
• Build and train a Transformer model
• Create your own intelligent chatbot using Mini GPT
• Use Hugging Face libraries for fine-tuning
• Optimize and deploy an LLM in under a few hundred MB
• Understand how modern LLMs actually work under the hood

📌 Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Tokenizers, Streamlit/Flask

💬 If you’re starting in AI/LLMs, this tutorial shows exactly how to turn a basic text dataset into your own functioning Mini GPT model.
